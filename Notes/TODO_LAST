Another visualization which allows for a direct comparison of the parameters,
suitable bar chart of relevant loss values, so that it is apparent which parameters are most relevant

A) is the pattern qualitatively the same for all samplesor are there differences throughout the year? 

---
once more to split the dataset by months and compute the heatmaps for each month separately, and illustrate whether there are variations throughout the year.
---

B) Can one find out things about multi-parameter relations, like if A and B both are noisy, then the prediction becomes particularly bad.

---
investigate the sensitivity of the losses wrt. the p-values for all the parameters.

compute sensitivities of the loss wrt these parameters via automatic differentiation.

go through all the samples, get a noisy prediction for all of them, compute the sample-wise reconstruction error and do a backprop to compute the gradient of the reconstruction error wrt. the p's.

I would guess that the gradients should all be positive, if not sample-wise, then at least on average (i.e. lower p -> lower reconstruction error).

But some of them might be larger than others, which would indicate that less noise in the respective parameter would improve ther reconstruction more strongly. 

In principle one can then compute such gradient sensitivities for all the interesting P_X and P_Other settings and one would see whether this reveals higher-order parameter interactions. This would be afirst step into the direction of sensitivity computations, and maybe one can refine that to also account for spatial variations.
