TRY DIFFERENT P VALUES FOR THE GRADIENT SENSITIVITY MAPS TO GET BETTER PATTERNS
NOW IT SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT RANDOM, EVERYTIME THE PATTERNS CHANGE, OR ONLY THE PIXELS IN THE VICINITY SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT


the greedy selection algorithm in the dropout paper,
when finding bigger similarity clusters, you can also iteratively rank the best
performing individual input parameters and put them in a group maybe?
